### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechatronic Engineer from Mexico currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE University. I'm passionate about data and its power to inform and drive decisions, and I'm excited to share my projects and insights with the GitHub community.

## About my Projects
My projects on GitHub showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. I believe in using data to solve real-world problems and create value for businesses and society. You'll find a mix of personal and academic projects that highlight my creativity and analytical abilities.
